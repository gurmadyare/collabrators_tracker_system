# React + Vite

Project Name: Project Collabrators Management System.

Description
-----------

This React project is designed to efficiently manage collaborators for a collaborative project. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can add new collaborators or update existing ones through a form. The form collects essential details such as collaborator’s name, birthdate, phone number, gender, and skillset. Client-side validation ensures data integrity, alerting users to any invalid information input. The application dynamically maintains a list of collaborators, seamlessly updating it as new entries are submitted. Moreover, intuitive navigation options facilitate effortless movement between different views for enhanced usability.
